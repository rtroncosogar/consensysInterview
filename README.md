There is my personal python snipet that was required from Viant Team

To use:

There is some requirements that must be accomplished, some of thems are:

 * Python 3.7
 * web3py
 * pysha3
 
 To install every single requirement, please before run:
 
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 
 Also, I highly recommend to create a virtualenv to test it.
