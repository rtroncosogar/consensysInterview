There is my personal python snipet that was required from Viant Team

To use:

There is some requirements that must be accomplished, some of thems are:

 * Python 3.7
 * web3py
 * pysha3
 
 To install every single requirement, please before run:
 
 `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
 
 Structure:
 ```bash
 - code
   - main.py
 - LICENSE
 - README.md
 - requirements.txt
 ```
 
 
 Also, I highly recommend to create a virtualenv to test it.
 
 Some useful knowledge, that I've used to make this possible:
